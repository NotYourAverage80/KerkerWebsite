        <h2> How screenchooser works...</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> <i>This refers to Alpha 0.01.3 and may be out of date</i> </p>
        <p> I guess while I’m working with it I might as well talk about it.</p>
        <p> The screenchooser variable is an integer that is used for, you guessed it,</p> 
        <p> choosing what basic screen is displayed (The main menu, main game, inventory, and settings).</p> 
        <p> Each screen has a different value in the variable. <br> The main menu is 1, the main game is 2, inventory is 3, and settings is 4.</p> 
        <p> However, there is an exception to it just producing 4 separate screens. If you are kicked out of running the main game, <br> and the screenchooser is set as 1337, it sets the info variables (the variables that make up the entirety of the infobox),<br>and kicks you back into the main game. The only way to get rid of the infobox text is to type ‘clear’ as a command. </p>
        <p>Anyways, I hope I explained this well enough and if you have anymore questions relating to this, ask me them, I’ll answer. </p>
