        <h2> Another Update about 0.01.4 </h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> I haven't worked on the game for a while due to my above average procrastination abilities. </p>
        <p> I'm finally getting down and dirty with this update. This update is mostly just about standardizing the interface.</p>
        <p> The next update will start dishing out a majority of the content that'll make this game, a game.</p>
        <p> I also plan to update the website and GitHub page with some excellent documentation for people who <br> want to fool around with the code in the game or actually make their own project. </p>
        <p> And by 'update the website', I mean, make it sexy.</p>
        <p> <b> Thanks </b> </p>
