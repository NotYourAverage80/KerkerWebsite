        <h2> Update about 0.01.4 </h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> I have some news that could be noteworthy. </p>
        <p> I am not going to use JFrame as part of the game. <br> I'm sticking with windows cmd line.</p>
        <p> This is due to my desired <i> A E S T H E T I C </i> for the game.</p> 
        <p> I also plan on removing the need for KeyEvents too. <br> I'm doing this because I'm going to focus on a different mechanic. </p> 
        <p> A storyline...</p> 
        <p> Everything else in the Update Checklist remains the same.</p>
        <p> <b> Thanks </b> </p>
