        <h2> Current plans...</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> I haven't been able to do any major work for a little while. The most recent release (0.01.3.2) isn't really major at all. <br> It does introduce some new code. But the new code serves little to no purpose.</p>
        <p> The new code involves textfield and JFrame, however I'm going to have to implement some sort of Java console, <br> or go all "Gnome Fortress" on it. What I mean is implementing some sort of 'curses' or images that represent ascii characters. </p> 
        <p> So, as of right now, I don't see me releasing any large updates for a long time. </p>
        <p> I imagine that I won't release 0.01.4 for perhaps a month. Which may allow me to decide on how I want it all to work. </p>
        <p> Also, after I solve this issue, I can get started on full playable levels. </p>
