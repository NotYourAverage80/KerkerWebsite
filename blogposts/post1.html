        <h2> First post...</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> Welcome to the the website of Kerker, <br> an open-source game that I am using to test <br> my ability to code.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> At this stage, it isn't fully formed. <br> It needs a lot of work.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> I hope you play the game and mess with the source code. <br> Right now though, I upload the game in an unorganized fasion. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> So I'm going to organize all of it for the 0.01.4 release, <br> Which should be a large update. </p>
        <p> It'll get improved gradually (as will this website). </p>
        <p> So enjoy!!!</p>
