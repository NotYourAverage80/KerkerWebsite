        <h1>Kerker Blog</h1>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <h2> Updates and stuff... </h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> So I decided to take a break from Kerker to work on another project I have.</p>
        <p> Now I'm back and I can continue working. <br> While I was away, <br> I came up with a list of things to add to the game.</p>
        <p> The additions will be listed on a page of the wiki, under 0.01.4 future additions. </p> 
        <p> </p> 
        <p> I decided that the game, because its open source, <br> needs to have things added (both in the game and in the repository). <br> One of these things is a user level designer. I figure it'd make it more enjoyable to play.</p> 
        <p> Maybe I'll make more stuff like that and add more user content related things to the game.</p>
        <p> I also transfered everything from my Endejeux Github to this one. </p>
