        <h2> We're that much closer... </h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p> I am very very close to releasing 0.01.4</p>
        <p> I have added level management and such. I am having an issue with the makeClear() method. <br> The display jitters everytime it clears the previous screen. So eventually, I'll have a fix for that. </p>
        <p> I might eventually create a patreon account to recieve help for this project. Who knows.</p>
        <p> I dunno. This blog post is really short, so here, enjoy <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bracer-crane/vaportrapnation">this</a>.</p>
        <p> Also, if you want to share this website, I recommend using <a href="https://kerker.ga">kerker.ga</a> or <a href="http://goo.gl/UeioZZ"> http://goo.gl/UeioZZ</a>. <br> With the second one I can keep track of who has gone on the website using: <a href="https://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/UeioZZ/all_time"> this </a>.</p>
        <p> <b> Thanks </b></p>
