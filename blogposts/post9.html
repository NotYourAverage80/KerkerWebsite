        <p> I can feel it. I'm getting a lot of things done, such as level-scripting. </p>
        <p> It's going really good. I'm actually excited. The only major problem right now is creating documentation.</p>
        <p> The reason for that is I never remember why I made something do a thing. </p>
        <p> Wish me luck...</p>
