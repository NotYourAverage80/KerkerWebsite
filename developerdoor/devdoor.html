        <h1> Hey There!</h1>
        <p> Do you really want to work on this project?</p>
        <p> If you do, there are a few things you need to do.</p>
        <p> First, you need a github account so you can be added to the list of contributors <br> for Kerker and its website. </p>
        <p> Second, you need to download <a href="http://eclipse.bluemix.net/packages/mars.2/data/eclipse-java-mars-2-win32.zip">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases/download/release-1.6/Brackets.Release.1.6.msi">Brackets</a>. <br> both are <i> free </i> tools you will need in order to work on both the website and the game. </p>
        <p> You ready?</p>
